\warn{This is an \bold{experimental} feature.}

Tracing in Concourse enables the delivery of traces related to the internal
processes that go into running builds, and other internal operations, breaking
them down by time, and component.

It currently only integrates with
\link{\italic{Jaeger}}{https://www.jaegertracing.io/}, although support for
other systems is planned to expand as the underlying SDK
(\link{\italic{OpenTelemetry}}{https://opentelemetry.io/}) evolves.


\section{
  \title{Configuring}

  There's only one variable that is required to be set in order to leverage
  Jaeger's integration with Concourse: \code{CONCOURSE_TRACING_JAEGER_ENDPOINT}.


  \codeblock{bash}{{{
  CONCOURSE_TRACING_JAEGER_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:14268/api/traces
  }}}

  This tells Concourse how to target Jaeger's Thrift HTTP endpoint to send the
  traces to.
